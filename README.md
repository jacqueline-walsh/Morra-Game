## Description

An applica1on to allow a user to play repeatedly the game “Morra Odds and Evens” with a computer. At the beginning of each game the user will be prompted to 
choose whether he/she would like to be the “Odds” or “Even” player. In each round of the game the user must decide the number of fingers to show (i.e. between 1 
and 10). Similarly, in each round of the game the computer will randomly pick a number between 1 and 10. In each round, the game displays the computer’s choice. 
After each round the game displays the number of points each player has, and whether the user or the computer won the round.

A game finishes when one of the players accumulates 6 points. At the end of a game, the game displays who the winner is, and a history of the numbers of fingers 
shown by both the user and the computer per round. Once a game has finished the applica1on asks the player if he/she would like to play another game. At the end 
of all games, display a history of games played. The history shows for each game the number of rounds won and lost by the human player, and how many even and odd 
numbers have been chosen by each player, and the extra points received by the player per game.
